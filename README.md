# `newtype-derive-2018`

The [newtype-derive](https://crates.io/crates/newtype-derive) modern fork.

This crate provides macros for deriving common traits for newtype structures.

All of these macros are designed to be used with
the [`macro-attr-2018`](https://crates.io/crates/macro-attr-2018) crate,
though they can be used independent of it.
